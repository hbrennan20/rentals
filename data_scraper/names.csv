Given the natural heritage focused work of the NPWS it is essential that all built heritage and new construction projects in the National Parks ensure that all aspects of the built and natural heritage are identified and sustained properly throughout every project. The environmental footprint of each project needs to be considered – all choices around design, construction, and selection of materials needs to be informed by those that have the lowest environmental impact – wherever possible materials should be repairable or recyclable and/or low carbon choices.
